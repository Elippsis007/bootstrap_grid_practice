## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the content it is showing.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme  
        -   The color scheme on my website I was going for was clean and simple. I used a light multi-tone color background accross all pages for consistency.
    -   #### Typography
        -    The Concert One font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Cursive as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Concert One is a strange font, it has characteristics that speak Gluten, I like the shape and the thickness of the font it has a type of "gooey" style to the font. I see it as both relative and appropriate a fun and engaging website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery in this website accross all content was to be fun and friendly.
