This is Glutonia a website designed to be responsive and accessible for a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for the information you are seeking.
Glutonia is a fun and simple way of learning about Gluten.
My project is a website with a humorous side of learning about Gluten.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme  
        -   The color scheme on my website I was going for was clean and simple.
I used a light multi-tone color background accross all pages for consistency.
    -    #### Typography
            The Concert One font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Cursive as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
Concert One is a strange font, it has characteristics that speak Gluten, I like the shape and the thickness of the font it has a type of "gooey" style to the font. 
I see it as both relative and appropriate a fun and engaging website.

-   #### Imagery
    -   Imagery in this website accross all content was to be fun and friendly.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   ### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time user, I wanted to easily portray the main purpose of the site and to show a little about the idea of the website.
    
        1. When visiting the site, users are greeted with a clean and easily readable transparent navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Centered in the home page is a simple login form with easily understandable text and instruction for a user to log in.
The main focus of the page here is the simplistic approach and clear instruction as to how to proceed further if desired.
The user has multiple options (inluding the navbar), click the call to action buttons on the form after inputting name and address which are REQUIRED.
        2. The main point on this page is made with the simple, clean and easy on the eye colors.
        3. The user here has a choice of 
        2. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
Toward the bottom of all the pages there is the social links that will redirect you to the various social platforms.
On the Contact Us Page you have a form to fill which is <i>non functioning</i>.

        3. Once the user has read the About Us text toward the end of the text there is a link which will redirect them to the main page of the website.
