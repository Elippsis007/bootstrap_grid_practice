# Glutonia

Glutonia is a fun and simple way of learning about Gluten.
My project is a website with a humors side of learnign about Gluten.

### Features

The website will have a carousel, a blog and a questionnaire form type.

## How to access Glutonia

Glutonia isn't a published site but can be accessed with request through GitHub.
It's designed for all devices, including any mobile phone.

## Purpose

It's a fun way of learning about Gluten and the types of effects it can have
on people. It's not supposed to be a serious website, because serious can
be boring.
It has 4 pages, login page, home page, about us and a contact page all built using
boostrap v4.

## Roadmap

This won't be a project I will continue to work on further in the future.
It is merely to show HTML & CSS skills.
